## SERVICES

## Business system reviews
We can review the way your organisation works along with the documentation and processes currently in use.  From this we will produce a report sympathetic to your business strategy detailing recommended changes required to improve the performance and streamline processes.

## Process mapping
From the most basic function to the highest level operation, process mapping can quickly help to determine areas of inefficiency and waste such as over processing, double handling, job role confusion etc.  As an independent we can offer impartial advice on best practices which in turn will help you determine the right skill sets for each aspect of your operation.

## Internal Audits
Processes are only as good as the people that use them so it is important to ensure that your team understand and follow your processes correctly.  We can carry out an independent review of the documented processes within your organisation to the current ISO 9001 and or 14001 standards as well as to your organisation’s requirements.  Agreed corrective actions will be documented with agreed timescales for completion, follow up audits can be conducted to ensure action closure.

## Supplier Audits
Key suppliers are as important to your delivery programme as your own internal processes.  Working closely with them ensures their understanding of your requirements and shows them that they are important to you as an effective supplier.  Our supplier audits can be tailored to your organisation’s needs and can be from a half day to multiple days’ duration depending on your needs.  A full report is provided with agreed timescales for completion of actions. Follow up audits can be conducted to ensure action closure.

## Gap analysis to ISO9001:2008
Thinking of becoming certified to ISO9001?  We can help by carrying out a review of your business and formulating an action plan based on the gap. Please contact us to discuss your requirements in further detail.

## Process documentation
According to the ISO 9001 standard there are various processes within your organisation which must be documented and instances where records must be kept.  We will review your requirements and needs and create a management system tailored for your organisation with the minimum of paperwork.

## Health and Safety health checks
Health and safety is vital in any workplace and at Jennings we are committed to helping you improve your Health and Safety performance. Based on HSG65 - Managing for Health and Safety, we will assess your workplace looking into your health and safety systems and provide positive feedback to help ensure your organisation is complying with your legal obligations.

## Health and Safety site inspections
Inspections are a vital element of any safety management system.  They are used to determine whether you are meeting the standard requirements as well as those you have set for your workplace and work activities.  When carried out effectively, they allow you to identify and remedy problems before they become more serious or result in an incident or accident.  We offer a thorough inspection of your site providing you with completed risk assessments as well as an action plan for completing remedial works wherever necessary.  We can assist you in carrying out any resulting action if required.

## Relief Quality Manager Service
We can offer full cover for short term absence such as holidays, training and even sabbaticals.  Or simply provide additional support to existing staff for short term workload increase or special projects.

## Continuous improvement & cultural change management
Embrace change within your organisation and empower everyone to push for continual improvement. Starting small we help to demonstrate where improvements can be made with the right level of dedication.  This unclutters roles by removing firefighting and allowing processes to be carried out more efficiently and cost effectively.  Once the results are realised, a training program is tailored for your needs which ensures the new culture is sustained.

## Key Performance Indicator Implementation & Management
To successfully measure the performance of your organisation, you need to ensure that you identify and focus on the correct areas of your business in line with your key objectives. We can help establish what these areas are and then help you decide how best to measure performance in those areas and set KPI's that align with your strategy, engage people and get results. These are then implemented into your organisation's reporting structure and ownership delegated to those in control of the outputs. Careful monitoring and reviewing of the system then leads the business in the right direction for Customer satisfaction, Effectiveness, Efficiency and Profitability.
